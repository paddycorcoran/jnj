ATM coding challenge
To load :
Clone the repository to your local machine and import project to Eclipse.

To run :
Right click project and Run as.. Java Application

Reads in the inputs from the file users.txt and the ATM.java file has the program entry point.
I created a CommonMethods class for common methods.
I also included a User.java class file which is commented out.This is just a class that could be used 
for storing the users details in objects.I was originally going to use but decided it wasnt needed.

Known issue :
The users.txt file needs a blank line at the end of the file.
